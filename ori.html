          Interesting facts about panda<br>
          <br>
          Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.<br>
          Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation<br>
          Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. <br>
          Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. <br>

          Interesting facts about flying-cicada<br>
          <br>
          Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.<br>
          Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.<br>
          Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.<br>
          Their predators, or animals that will eat them, don’t know they’re coming. Lots of animals, including birds, mice and raccoons, are in for a bug surprise!<br>
